# RTTI

RunTime Type Information is an advanced feature in Java. Everything in Java is object, this is the same in the Python. In Python even a function is an object. When you write a class in Java, after compilation, it will create an object, we call it `.class` file. For example, `Apple.java` will create a `Apple.class` file. 

Java class loader sub-system will load this object into memory, then start to instantiate other `Apple` objects. So in Java, a class is not only a template you generate objects, actually it also is object itself.
